### Hi there 👋

🛠️ Industrial Designer & Code Enthusiast 💻

👋 Hey there, I'm Diego Rivera Acosta! Welcome to my GitHub world where design meets code.

🎨 As an industrial designer by trade, I bring a unique perspective to the world of programming. I thrive on the intersection of aesthetics and functionality, turning ideas into beautifully crafted digital experiences.

💡 My Tech Toolkit:

HTML & CSS for building the foundation of great user interfaces.
JavaScript for adding interactivity and enhancing user experiences.
React for creating dynamic and responsive web applications.
Ruby on Rails for turning concepts into powerful web solutions.
🔧 When I'm not sketching new design concepts, you'll find me in the code trenches, working on projects that merge form and function. From sleek web interfaces to robust applications, I'm passionate about bringing ideas to life.

🌟 Let's connect and collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between design and technology. Together, we can craft the future one line of code at a time.
